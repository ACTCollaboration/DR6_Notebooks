# DR6_Notebooks
These notebooks have been developed by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration to demonstrate how one can use data products from ACT's Data Release 6 (DR6) to perform common analyses.

The data products used in these notebooks are publicly available on [Lambda](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/actadv_prod_table.html). 

Each notebook has been written to work in Google colab and can be accessed either by clicking the colab button in the notebook file above, or using the links below. Note: this will open a frozen, read-only version. It will still run, but if you want to edit or save your work, you will need to first save a copy of the colab notebook in your personal Google drive.

### Notebooks:

- [Cross correlations with ACT CMB Lensing Maps](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ACTCollaboration/DR6_Notebooks/blob/main/ACT_DR6_lensing_cross_correlation.ipynb)

- [Deriving the lensing transfer function]()

- [The lensing likelihood with cosmopower]()

If you use the data products referenced in these notebooks please cite the relevant papers from ACT:

- [Madhavacheril et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05203)
