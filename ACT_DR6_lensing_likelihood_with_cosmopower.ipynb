This is done by loading information about the ACT lensing data, including the covariance matrix and power spectrum, and running MCMC to estimate cosmological parameters. The MCMC library that we will use here is `Cobaya` ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05290), [ASCL](https://ascl.net/1910.019)), which is a general purpose statistical framework used in cosmological parameter estimation.\n","\n","In MCMC, we have to sample the parameter space and generate a theoretical power spectrum many times. Traditionally, this is done using Boltzmann theory codes such as CLASS ([code](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2932)) or CAMB ([code](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB/), [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...538..473L/abstract)). In this notebook, we instead make use of emulators made with Cosmopower ([code](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03846)), a set of trained neural networks that significantly speeds up the computation of theory power spectra and parameter estimation. These specific emulators here are trained with Stage IV accuracy requirements, as reported [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01591).\n","\n","Currently, the cosmopower emulators are wrapped within the class_sz ([code](https://github.com/CLASS-SZ/class_sz), [paper](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2715411)) code, which easily allows for exact evaluation of background and thermodynamics quantities while calling the cosmopower emulators to predict the CMB spectra.\n","\n","### ACT DR6 data products\n","\n","\n","The data for this release is publicly available on [Lambda](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/actadv_prod_table.html) and a full discussion of the ACT DR6 lensing analysis can be found in [Qu et al.
